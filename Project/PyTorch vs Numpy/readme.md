# PyTorch vs Numpy 

    Describing the similarities between the pytorch, and numpy and also compare their execution rates. 
    Kinda like benchmark, including Performance at creating uninitialized array, Performance at Array Operations, Array traversing, and comparison between Linear Algebra. 

## Tool:
    Pytorch numpy 

## Conclusion: 
    details can be shown in the notebook. And I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data as well as this project was inspired from the web page:
